# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-CNN
This project demonstrates how to use a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset**. The application is built using **TensorFlow/Keras** for model training and **Streamlit** for creating an interactive web app.

## 🚀 Features

- Train a CNN on handwritten digits (MNIST format)
- Automatically preprocess and normalize pixel data
- View accuracy and confusion matrix after training
- Display sample predictions (25 images)
- Upload custom MNIST-style CSV files
- Interactive interface with Streamlit
